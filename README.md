# Themes for Gedit 3

Version 0.1.0

---

This is based on the infamous mig/gedit-themes repository, but since it seems to be stagnant and not accepting pull
requests anymore I decided it was time to make things happen again. This fixes the install script and updates some
themes that looked terrible when the option to highlight the current line was selectd.

The install script could use some more work, but should be fully functional as it is. Pull requests are welcomed.

## Changelog

### 0.1.0
 - Replace install script with new one that works with Gedit 3
 - Remove railscasts2 and Rainbow Neon themes
 - Modify some themes that had no defined background color for current-line so that it always looks good
